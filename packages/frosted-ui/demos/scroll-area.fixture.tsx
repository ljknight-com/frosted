          Principles of the typographic craft

        <Typography.Text render={<p />}>
          Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and aesthetics. Although in a
          non-technical sense "legible" and "readable" are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate
          but related concepts.
        </Typography.Text>
        <Typography.Text render={<p />}>
          Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be distinguished from one another. It is described
          by Walter Tracy as "the quality of being decipherable and recognisable".
        </Typography.Text>
        <Typography.Text render={<p />}>
          Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their job to select the correct font to use. Using
          only uppercase letters (all-caps) reduces legibility.
