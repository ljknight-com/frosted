# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build/Lint Commands

### Monorepo

- **Install**: `bun install`
- **Dev server**: `bun run dev [--no-open] [--kill]` (`scripts/dev.ts`; react-cosmos through [portless](https://www.npmjs.com/package/portless), opens Safari when ready; `--kill` clears stale sessions)
- **Build**: `bun run build --filter=<app>`
- **Lint**: `bun run lint --filter=<app>`
- **Typecheck**: `bun run typecheck` (turbo for the packages, then root `tsconfig.json` for `scripts/` + `ci/`; TypeScript 7)
- **Full check**: `bun run check` — everything CI runs (workflows in sync, format, lint, typecheck, build, publint, attw)
- **Format**: `bun run format` / `bun run format:check` (oxfmt, JS/TS only — oxfmt would otherwise rewrite the generated workflow YAML and the markdown)
- **Regenerate the workflows**: `bun run workflows` (see [CI/CD](#cicd))
- **Screenshot every fixture**: `bun run screenshot [--static] [--out <dir>] [--filter <substr>] [--concurrency <n>] [--shard <i>/<n>]` (`scripts/screenshot-demos.ts`; headless via the `agent-browser` CLI, starts cosmos itself if it isn't running, writes `screenshots/` + a contact-sheet `index.html`). One shot per component, since a fixture page holds every example. `--static` serves the last `build:cosmos` export instead of the dev server (faster, but only as fresh as that build); `--shard` splits the work across machines.
- **Scaffold a component**: `bun run new:component <kebab-name> [--namespace] [--no-docs]` (`--no-docs` skips the usage demo)
- **Env problems**: `bun run doctor [--fix]` (stale nested node_modules, bun version)

### Dev URL (portless — no port numbers)

The react-cosmos playground is the only site; it runs from this laptop under the `frosted.localhost` tenant:

- **Cosmos playground**: <https://frosted.localhost> (`packages/frosted-ui`)
- **Renderer iframe**: <https://frosted-renderer.localhost> — a static portless alias to the vite dev server on 5050 (port pinned in `cosmos.config.json`, alias re-registered by `dev.ts` on every boot). Both URLs must be https: Safari (unlike Chrome) blocks plain-http `localhost` iframes inside an https page. Because the renderer sits behind the TLS proxy, `vite.config.ts` points the HMR websocket at `wss://…:443` — same trick the storybook config needed.

### The package (`@aussieljk/frosted`, in `packages/frosted-ui`)

- **Build**: `bun run --filter="@aussieljk/frosted" build`
- **Lint**: `bun run --filter="@aussieljk/frosted" lint`
- **Cosmos (standalone)**: `bun run --filter="@aussieljk/frosted" cosmos`
- **Static export**: `bun run build:cosmos` (from the root; writes `packages/frosted-ui/cosmos-export`)

## Code Style Guidelines

- **TypeScript**: Strict typing, ES2020 modules, 120 char line width, 2-space indentation
- **React**: Functional components with hooks, JSX format
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS v4, PostCSS with nesting/custom media/imports
- **Formatting**: Single quotes, semicolons required, trailing commas in multiline
- **Project**: Bun workspaces with Turborepo (`packages/*`, `tools/*`), Vite everywhere (no Next.js, no tests)
- **Commits**: Semantic commit messages (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore)
- **Quality**: oxlint for linting (root `.oxlintrc.json`), oxfmt for formatting (`bun run format`; lefthook pre-commit runs both on staged files), react-cosmos for the component workbench

## Publishing

The main package publishes to npm as `@aussieljk/frosted` (see `packages/frosted-ui`). Releases normally run from the **Release** workflow (Actions → Release → Run workflow); `bun run prod` does the same thing from this laptop.

**The version stays on 0.0.1 forever.** Every release is a prerelease of it — `0.0.1-1`, `0.0.1-2`, … — so the patch number never reaches 0.0.2. To release, from `packages/frosted-ui`:

```sh
bun run release   # npm version prerelease --no-git-tag-version && npm publish --tag latest
```

The pipeline is two root scripts, shared by `bun run prod` and the Release workflow so there is only one implementation:

- `scripts/release.ts` — refuses a dirty tree, writes `~/.npmrc` from `NPM_TOKEN` when running in CI, runs the package's `release` (bump + publish), refreshes `bun.lock` (**it records the workspace version** — skip this and the next `bun install --frozen-lockfile` fails in CI), commits and pushes.
- `scripts/deploy.ts` — `vercel pull` / `build` / `deploy --prebuilt`, so the site is built on the runner rather than by Vercel. Production with `--prod` or on a master push; otherwise a preview whose URL it comments on the PR.

`--tag latest` is required: npm refuses to publish a prerelease to the default tag, and without it `latest` would never move, so plain `bun add @aussieljk/frosted` would fail to resolve.

`prepublishOnly` runs `scripts/check-version.ts` (hard-fails on any version that isn't `0.0.1-<n>`), then lint + build.

Never publish a plain `0.0.1`: it outranks every later `0.0.1-N`, and `^0.0.1` ranges don't match prereleases, so consumers would be stuck on that one release. Installing normally (`bun add @aussieljk/frosted`) resolves the `latest` dist-tag and records `^0.0.1-N`, which does pick up subsequent `0.0.1-N` releases.

## CI/CD

**The workflows are written in TypeScript, not YAML.** `ci/workflows.ts` is the source; `bun run workflows` renders it to `.github/workflows/*.yml`, and CI fails if the YAML on disk has drifted (`bun run workflows:check`, the first step of the check job). Never hand-edit a file under `.github/workflows` — it will be overwritten, and the generator deletes any `.yml` there that isn't in the `workflows` map.

- `ci/dsl.ts` — the typed subset of the Actions schema, the step builders, and the YAML renderer (`Bun.YAML.stringify`, no dependency).
- `ci/workflows.ts` — the two workflows.
- `ci/generate.ts` — `bun run workflows` / `bun run workflows:check`.

Keep every `run:` a single line: Bun's YAML writer emits multi-line strings as quoted scalars with `\n` escapes instead of `|` blocks. Anything longer belongs in a `scripts/*.ts`, which is the point — the workflows stay a list of named one-liners and the logic is typechecked TypeScript.

**Workflows**

- **CI** — every PR and every push to master. `check` job: workflows-in-sync, format, lint, typecheck, build, package health (publint + attw), cosmos export. Then `deploy`: preview on PRs (URL commented on the PR), production on master.
- **Release** — manual `workflow_dispatch` on master, with a `deploy` input. Runs `bun run check`, then `scripts/release.ts` and `scripts/deploy.ts --prod`.

**Runners are [Blacksmith](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-runners/overview)** (`blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404`) — a drop-in `runs-on` swap. Blacksmith serves the stock `actions/cache` from a colocated cache, so there is nothing vendor-specific in the workflows and `actions/*` stays upstream. `Runner` in `ci/dsl.ts` types the full label set. `actionlint` flags these labels as unknown; that's expected.

**Except the release job, which runs on `ubuntu-latest` on purpose.** npm's trusted publishing only accepts cloud-hosted runners, and Blacksmith registers its boxes through GitHub's org-level *self-hosted* runner API — so an OIDC token minted on a Blacksmith runner is refused by the registry. Releases are manual and rare, so the slower runner costs nothing. Don't "unify" `RELEASE_RUNNER` with `RUNNER`.

**npm auth is trusted publishing (OIDC) — there is no npm token anywhere.** The release job's `id-token: write` mints an OIDC token that npm trades for short-lived, scoped publish rights, and provenance is attached automatically (public repo + public package). It is configured on npmjs.com under the package's Settings → Trusted publisher: org `ljknight-com`, repo `frosted`, workflow `release.yml`, no environment. Consequences worth knowing:

- **Never set `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` in the release job** — npm would quietly take the legacy token path and skip trusted publishing. `release.ts` hard-fails if it sees one.
- Needs npm ≥ 11.5.1 and node ≥ 22.14.0, hence `setup-node` with node 24 (which ships npm 11). `release.ts` re-checks and self-upgrades npm as a backstop.
- The workflow **filename** is part of the trust config. Renaming `release.yml` breaks publishing until npmjs.com is updated to match.
- `repository.url` in the package must match the GitHub repo exactly, or provenance fails.
- Local `bun run prod` is unaffected — it publishes with your `npm login` session.

**Secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Secret | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | <https://vercel.com/account/tokens> |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | `orgId` in `.vercel/project.json` (gitignored, so it has to be a secret) |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | `projectId` in `.vercel/project.json` |

A PR from a fork has no secrets, so `deploy.ts` skips with a warning instead of failing.

The release commit is pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, whose pushes deliberately do not trigger further workflow runs — so a release does not kick off a second CI + production deploy.

## Cosmos (component workbench)

- **The sidebar is a flat list of components, and there is no nesting.** One fixture file per component in `packages/frosted-ui/fixtures/<Component>.fixture.tsx`, each default-exporting a single `<Gallery>` element that renders *every* example of that component on one page. The file name *is* the sidebar label, so fixtures are named after the exported component (`AvatarGroup.fixture.tsx`, `InputOTP.fixture.tsx`, `HStack.fixture.tsx`) — the one place in the repo that isn't kebab-case. Renaming one on macOS needs `git mv` via a temp name: a case-only `git mv -f` deletes the file on a case-insensitive volume. Keep it that way: cosmos builds the sidebar from file paths, so a subdirectory under `fixtures/` (or a second fixture file for one component) re-introduces a tree node, and a default-exported *object* re-introduces per-variant sub-nodes.
- **How a fixture page is put together**: `const examples = { Name() {…}, Other: <X /> }` (function or element values both work) plus the component's usage demo, handed to `<Gallery examples={examples} demo={Demo} />` (`cosmos/Gallery.tsx`), which labels each section and rules a line between them. The demo leads, then the examples in declared order.
- **Usage demos live in `packages/frosted-ui/demos/<name>.demo.tsx`** and import from `@aussieljk/frosted` (aliased to `src/` in `vite.config.ts`) because their source is meant to be copy-pasteable. The `.demo.tsx` suffix keeps cosmos from indexing them as fixtures of their own — they reach the playground only through the component's Gallery. `demos/icons.demo.tsx` and `demos/layout.demo.tsx` have no component of their own, so `fixtures/icons.fixture.tsx` / `fixtures/layout.fixture.tsx` render the demo alone.
- **`cosmos.config.json` runs `lazy: true`** deliberately — eager mode imports every fixture (and therefore the whole library) into the renderer on first load, which is exactly the slow-boot problem the old setup was tuned to avoid.
- **No prop controls.** Fixtures render fixed examples; the props panel holds only the decorator's theme selects. A generated prop table (`cosmos/controls.ts` + `tools/props-gen`) used to seed one cosmos input per prop; it was deleted along with the controls-driven fixtures — restore it from git history if the playground ever wants live props again.
- **Theme/accent/gray selects** on every fixture come from the shared decorator (`cosmos/ThemeDecorator.tsx`, wired via `fixtures/cosmos.decorator.tsx`), which also mounts the `Toaster`. Global CSS enters through `globalImports` in `cosmos.config.json` → `cosmos/preview.css` (tailwind + built `styles.css` + `theme.css` — the dev script keeps both watched).
- **`index.html` at the package root is the cosmos renderer template** — the vite plugin rewrites its script tag to a virtual entry at serve time; the `/src/main.tsx` reference in it is never actually resolved.
- **Enumerate fixtures programmatically** with `getFixtures()` from `react-cosmos` (bun runs the TSX imports natively) — that's how `scripts/screenshot-demos.ts` gets its list; the dev server's `/cosmos.fixtures.json` only carries the renderer URL base.

## Sharp Edges

Non-obvious constraints — breaking any of these fails silently or in confusing ways:

- **`scripts/fix-namespace-exports.ts` must run after every tsdown build** (wired into `build:js`). Rolldown lowers `export * as Tabs` into materialized getter objects, which break React Server Components (`<Tabs.Root>` renders undefined: "Element type is invalid … got: undefined").
- **Dev never builds or watches `dist/`** — cosmos reads `src/` natively, and `vite.config.ts` aliases `@aussieljk/frosted` (and `/icons/*`) to `src/` so demo source can name the public package. Only the postcss watchers (`styles.css`, `theme.css`) run during dev. If you change the package's public entry points, check those aliases still cover them.
- **`sideEffects` in `packages/frosted-ui/package.json` must stay `["./dist/icons/adapters/*"]`**, not `false`. The icon adapter subpaths (`@aussieljk/frosted/icons/lucide` etc.) register themselves on import; `sideEffects: false` silently tree-shakes them.
- **TypeScript 7 (native compiler) is the repo default**, and it has no JS compiler API — anything needing it (the old `tools/props-gen`, now deleted) has to scope its own classic-TS pin in a workspace of its own.
- **`.stylelintrc.js` must stay `.js`** — stylelint's TS config loader calls classic-TS APIs that the TS7 native compiler doesn't export.
- **`src/styles/tokens/tailwind-color.css` is hand-maintained runtime CSS** (per-palette oklch seeds + `:where()` blocks computing all 12 steps via color-mix/relative color syntax). There is no generator anymore; edit it by hand. Tailwind palettes are prefixed `tw-` (`tw-indigo`) to coexist with the Radix scales.
- **Icon adapters in `src/icons/adapters/` are generated** — edit `scripts/icon-map.ts` and run `bun run generate:icon-adapters`; never edit the adapters directly.
- **`lucide-react` is v1.x** — the adapter uses v1 names (`House`, `Funnel`, `TriangleAlert`); pre-1.0 aliases like `Home` no longer exist despite the permissive peer range.
- **The vite renderer must dep-optimize in one pass** — `vite.config.ts` lists the fixture globs as `optimizeDeps.entries` and the full react-aria surface in `include`; a dep discovered mid-session forces a re-optimize that leaves two copies of react-aria's focus-visible global in the page ("Illegal invocation", blank renderer). The same reason `resolve.dedupe` is set.
- **`react-cosmos-plugin-vite` is patched** (`patches/`, wired via `patchedDependencies`): upstream derives the vite port from `rendererUrl`, which breaks when the rendererUrl is a reverse-proxied https URL with no explicit port — the patch falls back to `vite.port` from `cosmos.config.json`. Bumping the cosmos version requires re-checking the patch still applies.
- **If something is mysteriously broken, run `bun run doctor`** — under the hoisted linker, stale nested `packages/*/node_modules` dirs from older installs can shadow the root binaries (a package silently using an ancient `tsc`). `doctor --fix` deletes them.

## History

The repo used Storybook (docs site + stories) until 2026-07-23. The authored MDX docs pages are archived under `packages/frosted-ui/docs/` (no longer rendered by anything), and `packages/frosted-ui/docs/WHAT-WE-LOST-DROPPING-STORYBOOK.md` records exactly what the migration to react-cosmos gave up.
